# Price Match v0

Version 0 relies on both OpenAI and Cohere embedding APIs. Run either of the included scripts depending on the API you wish to use:

- `openaipricematcher.py`
- `coherepricematcher.py`

Each script opens a simple interface to select your inquiry file and produce a priced Excel sheet. A valid API key is required for the chosen service.
